# FdF
In this project, the Minilibx library is used. The program takes a map as a parameter and creates a 3D representation of it.

ðŸ”¹ This project is one of the projects that are going to prepare you for the next curriculum graphics project which is Cub3d or Minirt.

â–¶ï¸Ž  In linear algebra, a rotation matrix is a transformation matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space.Geometry provides us with four types of transformations, namely, rotation, reflection, translation, and resizing. Furthermore, a transformation matrix uses the process of matrix multiplication to transform one vector to another. When we want to alter the cartesian coordinates of a vector and map them to new coordinates, we take the help of the different transformation matrices.

â–¶ï¸Ž In 3D space, rotation can occur about the x, y, or z-axis.
