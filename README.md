## MiniLibX

  # DESCRIPTION
  
  MiniLibX is an easy way to create graphical software, without any X-Window/Cocoa programming knowledge. It provides simple window creation, a drawing tool, image and basic events 
  management.

  -> mlx.h should be included for a correct use of the MiniLibX API. It only contains function prototypes, no structure is needed.

  # LIBRARY FUNCTIONS
 
First of all, you need to initialize the connection between your software and the display.The mlx_init() function will create this connection. No parameters are needed, and it will return a void* identifier, used for further calls to the library routines.

If mlx_init() fails to set up the connection to the graphical system, it will return NULL, otherwise a non-null pointer is returned as a connection identifier.

 # LINKING MINILIBX ON MACOSX

‚ô¶Ô∏è To use MiniLibX functions, you‚Äôll need to link your software with the MiniLibX library, and several system frameworks:

## LINE DRAWING ALGORITHMS

   ## 1) DDA LINE ALGORITHM

   DDA (Digital Differential Analyzer) is a line drawing algorithm used in computer graphics to create a line segment between two specified endpoints. It is a simple and efficient algorithm that works by using the incremental difference between the x coordinates and y coordinates of the two endpoints to draw the line.
     
 üü• The steps involved in DDA line generation algorithm are:

‚ú£ Input the two endpoints of the line segment, (x1,y1) and (x2,y2).

‚ú£ Calculate the difference between the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the endpoints as dx and dy respectively.

‚ú£ Calculate the slope of the line as m = dy/dx.

‚ú£ Set the initial point of the line as (x1,y1).

‚ú£ Loop through the x-coordinates of the line, incrementing by one each time, and calculate the corresponding y-coordinate using the equation y = y1 + m(x ‚Äì x1).

‚ú£ Plot the pixel at the calculated (x,y) coordinate.

‚ú£ Repeat steps 5 and 6 until the endpoint (x2,y2) is reached.

DDA algorithm is relatively easy to implement and is computationally efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications. However, it has some limitations, such as the inability to handle vertical lines and the need for floating-point arithmetic, which can be slow on some systems.


   ## 2) BRESENHAM'S LINE ALGORITHM

   <img width="685" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-11-19 21 09 09" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/4220419b-e74d-4b1b-8bd0-12191363e8e0">


   Bresenham's line algorithm is a line drawing algorithm that determines the points of an n-dimensional raster that should be selected in order to form a close approximation to a 
 straight line between two points. It is commonly used to draw line primitives in a bitmap image (e.g. on a computer screen), as it uses only integer addition, subtraction, and bit 
 shifting.

 ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm only uses integer values, integer comparisons, and additions. This makes Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm more efficient, fast, and easier to calculate than the DDA algorithm.

 ‚ñ∂Ô∏é In this method, next pixel selected is that one who has the least distance from true line.

 ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The method works as follows:

   Assume a pixel P1'(x1',y1'),then select subsequent pixels as we work our may to the night, one pixel position at a time in the horizontal direction toward P2'(x2',y2').
   Once a pixel in choose at any step , The next pixel is :

   1- Either the one to its right (lower-bound for the line)
   2 - One top its right and up (upper-bound for the line)
    ‚ñ∂Ô∏é The line is best approximated by those pixels that fall the least distance from the path between P1',P2'.

 ‚ñ∂Ô∏é Once we choose a pixel, we have two possible pixels to select as the next pixel.
 
  1- Right side pixel (East ‚Äî E)

  2- Upper right pixel (North East ‚Äî NE)

 ![image](https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/c7b296df-3abd-4fad-9245-3364f58a73d8)
  
‚ú£ Assume current pixel coordinates are (x, y)

‚ú£ Select E as next pixel ‚Äî increment only X value by 1 - (x + 1, y)

‚ú£ Select NE as next pixel ‚Äî increment both X and Y values by 1 - (x + 1, y + 1)

‚ú£ To select the next pixel, we are using a decision parameter based on the slope error. If the slope error is greater than 0.5, the actual line is near the NE. The line is closer to E when the slope error is less than 0.5.

‚ú£ At each step, we need to calculate the decision variable incrementally by adding ‚ñ≥E or ‚ñ≥NE depending on the choice of the pixel.

 üü• The steps involved in Bresenham line generation algorithm are:

‚ú£ Declare variable x1, x2, y1, y2, d, E, NE, dx, dy

‚ú£ Enter value of x1,y1,x2,y2  ->>  (Where x1,y1are coordinates of starting point, And x2,y2 are coordinates of Ending point)

‚ú£ First, we need to calculate dx and dy
         dx = x2-x1
         dy = y2-y1
        
‚ú£ We use dx and dy values to calculate the initial decision variable (d). value of the decision variable is changed on each step.
         d = 2 * (dy - dx)

‚ú£ Similarly, we need to calculate ‚ñ≥E and ‚ñ≥NE values. After the first initiation, these values are not changed.
        E = 2 * dy
        NE = 2 * (dy - dx)
        
‚ú£ Now we have to decide what is the best pixel to choose next, NE or E. We are using the sign of decision parameter to take that decision.
         
   ‚ô¶Ô∏è Case 1: d ‚â§ 0

   We are going to select pixel E if the decision variable is negative or zero. In this scenario, we only increment the x value by 1 and calculate the new decision variable using ‚ñ≥E.     Remember to keep y value as it is.
  
   d = d + E
   x = x + 1
 
‚ú£ Case 2: d > 0

   When the decision variable is positive, select NE as the next pixel. In addition to calculating the new decision variable and increment the x value, need to increment the y value by 1.

   d = d + NE
   y = y + 1
   x = x + 1

Continue until x = x2

Up to now we only talked about the general scenario of this algorithm, where x1 < x2 and 0 < slope < 1. There are three other scenarios we need to consider.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Case 1: x1 > x2

   In this case, we should draw the line from left to right. Take (X2, Y2) as the starting point and (X1, Y1) as the endpoint, then continue the Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Case 2: slope < 0

   In the case of a negative slope, we can get the line with a positive slope by reflecting the original line around the X-axis. We perform Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm to the line with a    
   positive slope and reflect back around the X-axis to get the pixels.

 üü• EXAMPLE

 Draw a line from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). In this scenario, we assume that the slope is negative.
 Now, instead of using Bresenham from (x1, y1) to (x2, y2), use the algorithm on (x1, -y1) to (x2, -y2). After calculating all the pixels from (x1, -y1) to (x2, -y2), we change the sign of the y values of all the pixels to get the pixels for the original line.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Case 3: slope > 1

  In the case of the slope is greater than 1, we can use Bresenham‚Äôs algorithm by exchanging the x and y values. after the calculations, exchange the x and y values back to get the 
  pixels to display on the line.


## LINEAR GRADIENT

 Creates an image consisting of a gradual transition between two or more colors along a line.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é First of all we need to find current point position between two points with known colors. Position value must be expressed in percentages.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é You can calculate this value depending on which delta value is bigger. Delta between x values of known points or delta between y values.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Then for creating each light (Red, Green, Blue) we need to get light from start and end point and use linear interpolation. At the end we need to get new color by union red, green and blue light.

   ## Linear array index: 
   
   <img width="443" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 02 11 06" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/d51b5e24-9ad9-4558-8e16-a8ac957e37d5">
  
   Refers to the index number used to access an element at a specific position, treating a two or more dimensional array as a one-dimensional array. In a two-dimensional array, it is used to access the element at a position, usually expressed as (row, column) or (x, y).


   For example, consider a matrix:

   <img width="94" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 02 12 16" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/c7f34f2d-2623-4acb-b1de-8f8a13e6b392"> 

   The indices of this matrix in the linear array are as follows:
   
   <img width="239" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 02 12 29" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/894ea3b2-cf17-45ad-9e32-43b6b2e6d2c8">

With these indices you can access each element. For example, you can access the number 8, the element at position (2, 1), with 7 as the linear array index.

## Color for pixel :

 And the most interesting is the second function with such parameters as bits_per_pixel and endian.
 
‚ñ∂Ô∏é What is bits per pixel or bit-depth value?
    The number of bits used to define a pixel's color shade is its bit-depth. True color is sometimes known as 24-bit color. Some new color display systems offer a 32-bit     color mode. The extra byte, called the alpha channel, is used for control and special effects information.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Endian is the most important parameter that we have to consider. For macOS its value is 0, which means little endian.
‚ñ∂Ô∏é Big-endian and little-endian are the formats of ordering bytes. Big-endian is the format that we used to know as normal. Little-endian order is reversed.

  <img width="239" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 02 12 29" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/d6309020-b9e7-4924-a666-a1f2bffe76eb">

So in the case of little-endian format, you have to use reversed order of color components.


## ROTATION MATRIX

![image](https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/4fd8aff4-5bce-417f-a97e-5f13a506f745)   

‚ñ∂Ô∏é  In linear algebra, a rotation matrix is a transformation matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space.Geometry provides us with four types of transformations, namely, rotation, reflection, translation, and resizing. Furthermore, a transformation matrix uses the process of matrix multiplication to transform one vector to another. When we want to alter the cartesian coordinates of a vector and map them to new coordinates, we take the help of the different transformation matrices.

## 3D Rotation

![image](https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/8e04f711-a3f7-4a3e-939f-0fa7a585adc5)


‚ñ∂Ô∏é In 3D space, rotation can occur about the x, y, or z-axis.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Our goal is to construct three 3x3 matrices, one for each rotation about one of the axes.

## 3D Rotation Around the Z-Axis

<img width="252" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-11-19 19 43 51" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/5f5841d5-33f4-43a4-999c-123bb07fbe5a">

‚ñ∂Ô∏é We know that we don't want to affect the z-components of the other basis vectors as they rotate around the z-axis, so we put 0's in the z-components.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é We're using a left-handed coordinate system here, meaning that the x-axis points to the right, the y-axis up, and the z-axis into the screen.S


## 3D Rotation Around the X-Axis

<img width="254" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-11-19 19 44 11" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/434b620b-0f9e-49ca-ae81-c22d5063be8d">

Now we are interested in the y components and the z components. The x components of the basis vectors are fixed in place because we are rotating around the x axis.


## 3D Rotation Around the Y-Axis

<img width="254" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-11-19 19 44 21" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/a765ecf5-f202-4dde-b770-655de85e616a">


Now we are interested in the x components and z components. The x components of the basis vectors are fixed in place because we are rotating around the y axis.

## ISOMETRIC PROJECTION

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Isometric projection is a projection technique used to project a 3D object onto a 2D plane. Isometric projection transfers the three-dimensional structure of the object onto a two-dimensional surface, preserving the proportions of distance, width and height.

<img width="697" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 01 10 06" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/a14411ea-e3fe-4d96-b6f6-a9948edfa3d5">



‚ñ∂Ô∏é In isometric projection, the plan shows the three visible sides of the object from the same angle to each other. Thus the isometric projection shows the sides of the object at an angle of 120 to each other. Thus these lines of the object are called isometric axes.

‚ñ∂Ô∏é Lines that are not parallel to the isometric plan are called non-isometric lines. In isometric projection, two isometric axes are held at an angle of 30 with the horizontal plane. While the third axis forms an angle of 90 with the horizontal plane.


## Methods of Isometric Drawing

  ## 1. Box Method

This method of isometric drawing is simple. But it takes a lot of time to draw. In box method, the maximum length, width, and height of the object are noted.

These parameters are created according to the method of a box. These parameters of the box are represented as isometric projections.

Make angles of 30 and 90 degrees along the horizontal line in this way. This way the other parts of the object are displayed.

Isometric lines are drawn in this way parallel to the isometric axis. Non-isometric lines, circles, and other curves are then drawn. Extra lines are erased at the end of the drawings.

  ## 2. OffSet Method

In this method, to create an iso view, the side of the object is selected. The length and width of objects are drawn parallel to the isometric axis.

Non-isometric lines, circles, and other curves are then drawn. Extra lines are erased at the end of the drawings.

## Formula 



<img width="443" alt="Ekran Resmi 2023-12-10 01 34 06" src="https://github.com/facetint/FdF/assets/99668549/ff556f98-2fa7-4a10-a19a-d0b1cf690cfe">

</div

These formulas are commonly used to express isometric projection, describing how a point in 3D space is projected onto a 2D plane with respect to the isometric angle. It's important to understand the original coordinates and the isometric angle before applying these formulas.
