In this project, the Minilibx library is used. The program takes a map as a parameter and creates a 3D representation of it.

ðŸ”¹ This project is one of the projects that are going to prepare you for the next curriculum graphics project which is Cub3d or Minirt.

                                                                                                  perform a rotation in Euclidean space.
